IMP: What does the vt driver DO?
It does the work of the 'Terminal emulator'
in this http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/case3.png .

scr_writew() writes to the VGA console.


In C, function pointers can be used to call the function without explicitly using
a * to dereference.
eg. fptr points to fn that returns int and takes a char parameter
int x = *fptr ('a');
and also
int x = fptr ('a');
Can be used.

Terminals we use inside the GUI are pty s (see man pty)
the command `tty` prints the file name of the tty currently connected to 
standard input

Possibly helpful (Is about a driver for serial console, but still)

ldisc: line discipline

Ttys etc from the user's pov:
http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty

struct termios is used to hold all the line settings for a specific port 
on the tty device (line settings include baud rate etc, see linusakesson link).
(tty0 is one tty port)

Compiling with CONFIG_VT option enables virtual terminals in the kernel.
